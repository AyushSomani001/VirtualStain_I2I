This is the code for Virtual Labeling of Mitochondria in Living Cells using Correlative Imaging and Physics-guided Deep Learning. Figure (A) outlines the proposed method. The red coloured numbers represent the principal modules and their sequence, and Figure (B) conditional GAN of the employed architecture.
The details of the architecture are presented in section 2.3.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- PyTorch 1.0.1 or higher, with NVIDIA CUDA Support
- Tensorflow 1.10.0 or higher
- Other required python packages specified by `requirements.txt`. See the Installation.

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/AyushSomani001/VirtualStain_I2I.git
```

Create a conda environment for VS, and install the requirements. This includes the required python packages
from `requirements.txt`. Most of the required packages have been included in the built-in `anaconda` package:

```
conda create -n VS anaconda
conda activate VS
```

Install all the dependencies and libraries associated with the conda environment:

```
conda install python=3.5
conda install requirement.txt
```

## Dataset preparation

To replicate the experiments, you need to prepare your dataset as the following. Taking the Microscopy dataset as an example and creating just the training and test set split.

```
Microscopy
â”œâ”€â”€ train_A
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ images (Contains BrightField images)
â”œâ”€â”€ train_B
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ images (Contains Fluroscent counterpart images)
â”œâ”€â”€ test_A
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ images
â””â”€â”€ test_B
    â””â”€â”€ images
```
