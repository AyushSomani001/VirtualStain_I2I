# Virtual Labeling of Mitochondria in Living Cells using Correlative Imaging and Physics-guided Deep Learning
This is the code for Virtual Labeling of Mitochondria in Living Cells using Correlative Imaging and Physics-guided Deep Learning.

This code in this repository can be used to run training and inference of our model on a single machine, and can be adapted for distributed training. 
This README will explain how to:
